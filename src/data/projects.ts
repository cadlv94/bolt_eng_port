    fullDescription: [
      "The **C-RX Pen Injector** is a patient-centric drug delivery device designed for use in compounding pharmacies. It supports **borosilicate glass cartridges** and delivers precise 0.1 mL dosing, improving accessibility for patients with dexterity or vision issues. Unlike traditional vial-and-syringe setups, this pen injector simplifies administration, enhances safety, and reduces medical waste by over 95%.",
      "Designed using **PEEK** and **borosilicate glass**, the C-Rx Pen is meant to be implemented in the sterile pharmacy workflow, following current USP 797 standards, it is compatible with both aqueous and oil-based formulations. The device includes a dose dialer, reusable housing, and standard pen needle compatibility. Testing and validation were conducted in collaboration with **CTRx Compounding Pharmacy**, ensuring real-world usability and regulatory alignment."
